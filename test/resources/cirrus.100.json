They were famous for developing and promoting dancing in the period of the First World War. Vernon Castle (2 May 1887 \u2013 15 February 1918) was born William Vernon Blyth in Norwich, Norfolk, England. Irene Castle (17 April 1893 \u2013 25 January 1969) was born Irene Foote, the daughter of a prominent physician in New Rochelle, New York. Vernon chose 'Castle' as a stage name when he first performed as a comic, because his sister (also on the stage) already used the family name, Blyth. He had already taken the name before Irene met him in 1910.p33   Vernon was initially trained to become a civil engineer. He moved to New York in 1906. There he became established as a comic actor and conjuror. Irene studied dancing and performed in several amateur theatricals before meeting Vernon in 1910. The next year, over her father\u2019s objections, the two were married. The English-born Vernon had already established himself as a dancer in comedic roles. His specialty was playing a gentleman drunk, who elegantly fell about the stage while trying to hide his condition. After their marriage, Irene joined Vernon in The Hen-Pecks (1911), a production in which he was a featured player. The two then travelled together to Paris to perform in a dance revue. The show closed quickly, but the couple were hired as a dance act by the Caf\u00e9 de Paris. Performing the latest American dances, the Castles were soon the rage of Parisian society. They introduced American ragtime dances, such as the Turkey Trot and the Grizzly Bear. When the Castles returned to the U.S. in 1912, their success was repeated on a far wider scale. Making their New York debut at a branch of the Cafe de Paris, the duo were soon in demand on stage, in vaudeville and in motion pictures. In 1914, the couple opened a dancing school in New York called Castle House, a nightclub called Castles by the Sea on the Boardwalk in Long Beach New York, and a restaurant, the Sans Souci.  In addition to cabaret, the Castles also became staples of Broadway. The Castles' greatest success was on Broadway, in Irving Berlin's debut musical Watch Your Step (1914). In this extravaganza, the couple refined and popularized the Foxtrot, which vaudeville comedian Harry Fox may have invented. After its New York run, Watch Your Step toured through 1916. The Castles helped remove the stigma of vulgarity from close dancing. The Castles\u2019 performances, often set to ragtime and jazz rhythms, also popularized African-American music among well-heeled whites. Irene\u2019s fashion sense, too, started national trends. Her elegant, yet simple, flowing gowns were often featured in fashion magazines. She also introduced American women to the bob\u2014the short hairstyle favored by flappers in the 1920s (see also Louise Brooks). The Castles appeared in a newsreel called Social and Theatrical Dancing in 1914 and wrote a bestselling instructional book, Modern Dancing, later the same year. The pair also starred in a feature film called The Whirl of Life (1915), which was well-received by critics and public alike. As the couple's celebrity increased in the mid-1910s, Irene Castle became a major fashion trendsetter, with her bobbed hair and shorter skirts. Her chic wardrobe was supplied almost exclusively by the couturi\u00e8re 'Lucile', (Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon) but Irene also designed some of her clothes herself. The slim, elegant Castles were trendsetters in many ways: they travelled with a black orchestra, had an openly lesbian manager, and were animal rights advocates long before it became a public issue. The Castles endorsed Victor Records and Victrolas. They issued records by the Castle House Orchestra, led by James Reese Europe \u2013\u2013 a pioneering figure in Black music. They also lent their names to advertising for other products, from cigars and cosmetics to shoes and hats. They were, in short, personalities of the modern kind, who had a gift for self-publicity. They were as famous as any film stars of the day.  Vernon returned to the UK to become a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Flying over the Western Front he shot down two aircraft and was awarded the French Croix de Guerre in 1917. He was posted to Canada to train new pilots, and then promoted to Captain and posted to the US to train American pilots. While flying at Benbrook Field, near Fort Worth, Texas, he took emergency action shortly after take off to avoid another aircraft. His plane stalled, and he was unable to recover control. Vernon was the only casualty. Fatally injured, he died soon after the crash, on February 15, 1918(1918-02-15) (aged\u00a030). Irene paid tribute to Vernon in her memoir My Husband, 1919.  Irene starred solo in about a dozen silent movies between 1917 and 1924 and appeared in several stage productions before retiring from show business. She married three more times \u2013\u2013 to Robert Treman, Frederic McLaughlin, and George Enzinger. In 1939, her life with Vernon was turned into a movie, The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle, produced by RKO and starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Irene served as a technical advisor on the movie, but clashed with Rogers, who refused to short bob or darken her hair. Irene also objected to white actor Walter Brennan playing their servant: \"Walter was BLACK\". For the rest of her life, Irene was a staunch animal-rights activist, ultimately founding the Illinois animal shelter \"Orphans of the Storm\", which is still active. Irene died January 25, 1969(1969-01-25) (aged\u00a075). Vernon and Irene Castle are interred together in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York.

Good examples are insects and amphibians. Life for most insects begins as a larva or nymph then progresses to the pupa stage and ends as an adult.             There are two main types of metamorphosis in insects: simple metamorphosis or hemimetabolism, and complete metamorphosis or holometabolism.  Insects who go through simple (or incomplete) metamorphosis have three life stages. These insects start as eggs, which are usually very small. When the egg hatches, a larva or nymph comes out. Nymphs are just baby insects. Most of the time, the nymph looks similar to the adult, but it is smaller, may have different colouration, and does not have wings. The nymph grows through stages called instars, shedding its 'skin' (epicuticle) at each stage (ecdysis). Finally, it changes into a mature adult with wings. Some insect nymphs are aquatic, which means they live in water. These nymphs usually have gills and look very different from the adults they will turn into. Nymphs that live in water are called naiads. Some insects that have a life cycle of egg-nymph-adult are: cockroaches dragonflies grasshoppers true bugs  Insects that have complete metamorphosis have four life stages. These insects start as eggs, which are very small. The egg hatches and a larva comes out. The larva looks like a worm and eats and eats so that it can grow much bigger. When the larva has grown it changes into a pupa. The pupa usually can not move or eat. The pupa is a special time when the insect is changing into an adult that will look very different from the larva or the pupa. Moth pupae (plural of pupa) are inside cocoons. When the pupa opens, the adult insect comes out. Many insects have a life cycle of egg-larva-pupa-adult. Some of these insects are: Coleoptera: beetles Hymenoptera: bees, wasps, ants, sawflies Lepidoptera: butterflies, moths Diptera: the flies  The monarch butterfly goes through four stages of development. Life for a monarch butterfly begins as an egg hatched from an adult. This egg then develops into a worm-like larva caterpillar. In the pupa or chrysalis stage, the caterpillar spins a silk pad on a twig or leaves and hangs from this pad by its last pair of prolegs. It hangs upside down in the shape of a \"J\" and then molts leaving it encased in a green exoskeleton. The mature butterfly emerges after about two weeks and feeds on a variety of flowers including milkweed flowers, red clover and goldenrod.            In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads, and newts all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Afterwards, newt larvae start a predatory lifestyle, while tadpoles mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges.  Many marine species have evolved a system where they release their eggs and sperm into the water at the same time, and fertilisation takes place in the sea over one or two days. This increases their chance of reproductive success. Then, larvae join the other plankton, eating and growing before metamorphosing into adults. Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a life cycle with pelagic larvae or even pelagic eggs. These have the capacity to be transported long distances, and so spread the species around to other places.  The need for metamorphosis is clear when the relative size of eggs and adults is understood. A mature Atlantic cod can reach two metres long, and weigh over 200 pounds (96 kgm). The female will produce over 100,000 eggs in a single spawning, and the resulting larvae are quite tiny. There is no way they could live like the adults, which are more or less top predators. The larvae cannot even swim against the current. Therefore they must live a different kind of life before they can live as the adults do. Their development is packaged into stages, and each stage has adaptations to life at its stage. The sharp distinction between stages (best seen in insects) is presumably because a longer transition would leave the juvenile less fit, either at its younger or older ways of life.

Its formal name is 134340 Pluto. The dwarf planet is the ninth-largest body that moves around the Sun. At first, Pluto was called a planet. Now, it is the largest body in the Kuiper belt. Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice. It is quite small. It is about a fifth (\u2155) of the weight of the Earth's Moon. It is only a third (\u2153) its volume. It has an odd orbit and this orbit is very sloped. It takes Pluto to 30 to 49\u00a0AU (4.4\u20137.4 billion\u00a0km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than Neptune. Since it was discovered in 1930, Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 1970s, the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small size. Later, in the early 21st century, the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered. Eris was initially believed to be 27% larger than Pluto, but was later found to be slightly smaller.  On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gave a definition to the word \"planet\" for the first time. By this definition, Pluto was not a planet anymore. It became a \"dwarf planet\" along with Eris and Ceres. After this, Pluto was put on the list of minor planets. It was given the number 134340. A number of scientists continue to hold that Pluto should be classified as a planet. Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, are sometimes called a \"binary system\". This is because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within them. The IAU has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, they classify Charon as a moon of Pluto. Pluto has four known smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, discovered in 2005, Kerberos, discovered in 2011, and Styx, discovered in 2012.   In the 1840s, using Newtonian mechanics, Urbain Le Verrier predicted the planet Neptune existed. He discovered this after studying the orbit of Uranus. Neptune was seen later in the late 19th century. Astronomers then felt that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet. In 1906, Percival Lowell, a person from Boston began an extensive to search the ninth planet. He called it \"Planet X\". By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested many possible places in the Solar System where the planet could be. Lowell continued the research till 1916. However, it fetched no good result. On March 19, 1915, his observatory had captured two images of Pluto. Lowell did not know this. The pictures were not recognized then for what they were. Constance Lowell, Percival's widow had a ten-year long legal battle for Percival's estate. For this reason, the search for Planet X again started in 1929. The director of the mission, Vesto Melvin Slipher, gave the job to Clyde Tombaugh, a 23-year-old Kansas man. Tombaugh had just come at the Lowell Observatory. Slipher had been impressed by his astronomical drawings. Tombaugh's had to systematically get pictures of the night sky in pairs every two weeks. Then, he had to look at each pair, to see whether any object had shifted. He used a machine called a blink comparator. He quickly shifted between the different views of each of the plates. This helped him to see whether any object had changed their position. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered an object which seemed to move from the photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of the year. Another picture taken on January 21 confirmed this. After the observatory did more research about it, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.  The discovery made headlines across the Earth. The Lowell Observatory had the right to name the new object. They received over 1000 suggestions from all over the world. Some proposed Atlas as the name. Others wanted to name it Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did. Constance Lowell proposed Zeus, then Lowell, and finally Constance. These suggestions were not used. The name Pluto was proposed by Venetia Burney (later Venetia Phair). She was an 11-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England then. Venetia was interested in classical mythology and astronomy. The name was of the Roman god of the underworld. She thought it was a good name for a dark and cold world. She suggested it when she was talking with her grandfather Falconer Madan. He was a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library. Madan passed the name to Professor Herbert Hall Turner. Turner told this proposed name to the astronomers in the United States. The object was officially named on March 24, 1930. Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three names. The names were Minerva (which was already the name for an asteroid), Cronus, and Pluto. Pluto received all votes. The name was announced on May 1, 1930. Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia five pounds as a reward. The name became popular in culture. The Disney character, Pluto, was introduced in the same year. He was named in the object's honor. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto. This was to keep the tradition of naming new elements after newly discovered planets. For example, uranium had been named after Uranus, and neptunium after Neptune.

Its [[Minor planet names|formal name]] is '''134340 Pluto'''. The dwarf planet is the ninth-largest body that moves around the [[Sun]]. At first, Pluto was called a planet. Now, it is the largest body in the [[Kuiper belt]].\n\nLike other [[wikt:member|members]] of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice. It is quite small. It is about a fifth (\u2155) of the weight of the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]]. It is only a third (\u2153) its volume. It has an [[orbital eccentricity|odd]] orbit and this orbit is very sloped. It takes Pluto to 30 to 49&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] (4.4\u20137.4 billion&nbsp;km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]]. \n\nSince it was discovered in 1930, Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 1970s, the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small size.<ref name=ridpath>{{cite journal|author=Ian Ridpath|title=Pluto\u2014Planet or Impostor?|url=http:\/\/myweb.tiscali.co.uk\/ianridpath\/Pluto.pdf|journal=Astronomy|date=December 1978 |pages=6\u201311}}<\/ref>\nLater, in the early 21st century, the [[scattered disc|scattered disc object]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and other objects like Pluto were discovered.

Its formal name is 134340 Pluto. The dwarf planet is the ninth-largest body that moves around the Sun. At first, Pluto was called a planet. Now, it is the largest body in the Kuiper belt. Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice. It is quite small. It is about a fifth (\u2155) of the weight of the Earth's Moon. It is only a third (\u2153) its volume. It has an odd orbit and this orbit is very sloped. It takes Pluto to 30 to 49\u00a0AU (4.4\u20137.4 billion\u00a0km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than Neptune. Since it was discovered in 1930, Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 1970s, the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small size. Later, in the early 21st century, the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered. Eris was initially believed to be 27% larger than Pluto, but was later found to be slightly smaller.  On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gave a definition to the word \"planet\" for the first time. By this definition, Pluto was not a planet anymore. It became a \"dwarf planet\" along with Eris and Ceres. After this, Pluto was put on the list of minor planets. It was given the number 134340. A number of scientists continue to hold that Pluto should be classified as a planet. Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, are sometimes called a \"binary system\". This is because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within them. The IAU has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, they classify Charon as a moon of Pluto. Pluto has four known smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, discovered in 2005, Kerberos, discovered in 2011, and Styx, discovered in 2012.","language":"en","wikibase_item":"Q339","version":5531216,"version_type":"external","score":5.0646392416452e-5,"popularity_score":7.0083120269389e-5,"wiki":"simplewiki","coordinates":[],"defaultsort":false}

He was also known as 'Imam Khomeini'. Khomein was the political leader of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Khomeini was also a poet. His poems are collected together in an Imam Divan. Khomeini died of intestinal cancer and a heart attack on June 3, 1989, in Tehran at the age of 87.   On June 5, 1964, Khomeini was arrested and sent into exile. He was exiled to Iraq, Turkey and then to France. Khomeini gave many speeches in France against Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. On January 16, 1979, Pahlavi left Iran. Two weeks later, on February 1, Khomeini returned to Iran. He received a traditional religious education in Qom (city in Iran). When he lived in Najaf (a holy city in Iraq) for some years, he spoke about Islam ideas about Government. During that time, he refined his theory of velayat-e faqih (\"government of the jurist\"). On February 11, 1979, Khomeini appointed his first own prime minister, Medhi Bazargan. On March 30, 1979 a referendum took place in Iran and as a result, the monarchy was replaced with an Islamic Republic. After the Islamic Revolution, Khomeini became Supreme Leader of Iran.  In early 1989 Khomeini issued a fatw\u0101 calling for Muslims to kill Salman Rushdie and \"all those involved in the publication\" of his book called The Satanic Verses. Rushdie has never been killed. However the Japanese translator of the book was stabbed to death in 1991.

The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30\u00a0cm wide. Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgundy (red + purple) flower head. The flower head is actually an inflorescence made of hundreds or thousands of tiny flowers called florets. The central florets look like the centre of a normal flower, and the outer florets look like yellow petals. All together they make up a \"false flower\" or pseudanthium. The benefit to the plant is that it is very easily seen by the insects and birds which pollinate it, and it produces thousands of seeds. The sunflower is the state flower of Kansas. That is why Kansas is sometimes called the Sunflower State. To grow well, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, wet, well-drained soil with a lot of mulch. In commercial planting, seeds are planted 45\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0ft) apart and 2.5\u00a0cm (1\u00a0in) deep.            The outer petal-bearing florets are the sterile florets and can be yellow, red, orange, or other colours. The florets inside the circular head are called disc florets, which mature into seeds. The flower petals within the sunflower's cluster are always in a spiral pattern. Generally, each floret is oriented toward the next by approximately the golden angle, 137.5\u00b0, producing a pattern of interconnecting spirals, where the number of left spirals and the number of right spirals are successive Fibonacci numbers. Typically, there are 34 spirals in one direction and 55 in the other; on a very large sunflower there could be 89 in one direction and 144 in the other. Sunflowers commonly grow to heights between 1.5 and 3.5\u00a0m (5\u201312\u00a0ft.). The tallest sunflower confirmed by Guinness World Records is 9.17 m (2014, Germany). In 16th century Europe the record was already 7.3 m (24\u00a0ft., Spain). Most cultivars are variants of H. annuus, but four other species (all perennials) are also domesticated. This includes H. tuberosus, the Jerusalem Artichoke, which produces edible tubers.  Sunflower \"whole seed\" (fruit) are sold as a snack food, after roasting in ovens, with or without salt added. Sunflowers can be processed into a peanut butter alternative, Sunbutter. In Germany, it is mixed together with rye flour to make Sonnenblumenkernbrot (literally: sunflower whole seed bread), which is quite popular in German-speaking Europe. It is also sold as food for birds and can be used directly in cooking and salads. Sunflower oil, extracted from the seeds, is used for cooking, as a carrier oil and to produce margarine and biodiesel, as it is cheaper than olive oil. A range of sunflower varieties exist with differing fatty acid compositions; some 'high oleic' types contain a higher level of healthy monounsaturated fats in their oil than Olive oil. The cake remaining after the seeds have been processed for oil is used as a livestock feed. Some recently developed cultivars have drooping heads. These cultivars are less attractive to gardeners growing the flowers as ornamental plants, but appeal to farmers, because they reduce bird damage and losses from some plant diseases. Sunflowers also produce latex and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing hypoallergenic rubber. Traditionally, several Native American groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a \"fourth sister\" to the better known three sisters combination of corn, beans, and squash.[9] Annual species are often planted for their allelopathic properties.[source?] However, for commercial farmers growing commodity crops, the sunflower, like any other unwanted plant, is often considered a weed. Especially in the midwestern USA, wild (perennial) species are often found in corn and soybean fields and can have a negative impact on yields. Sunflowers may also be used to extract toxic ingredients from soil, such as lead, arsenic and uranium. They were used to remove uranium, cesium-137, and strontium-90 from soil after the Chernobyl disaster (see phytoremediation).    Adam, John A. 2002.

Sunflowers also produce latex and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing hypoallergenic rubber.\nTraditionally, several [[Native American]] groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a \"fourth sister\" to the better known three sisters combination of corn, beans, and squash.[9] Annual species are often planted for their allelopathic properties.{{fact|date=September 2013}} However, for commercial farmers growing commodity crops, the sunflower, like any other unwanted plant, is often considered a weed. Especially in the midwestern USA, wild (perennial) species are often found in corn and soybean fields and can have a negative impact on yields.\nSunflowers may also be used to extract toxic ingredients from soil, such as lead, arsenic and uranium. They were used to remove uranium, cesium-137, and strontium-90 from soil after the Chernobyl disaster (see phytoremediation).\n\n== References ==\n{{commons|Helianthus annuus}}\n{{wikispecies|Helianthus annuus}}\n{{wiktionary|Sunflower|Sunflower}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Flowers]]\n[[Category:Asterales]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Kansas]]","language":"en","wikibase_item":"Q171497","version_type":"external","version":5539488,"popularity_score":0.00043546210227073,"coordinates":[],"wiki":"simplewiki","defaultsort":false,"opening_text":"The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is an annual plant in the family Asteraceae, with a large flower head (capitulum). The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30\u00a0cm wide. Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgundy (red + purple) flower head. The flower head is actually an inflorescence made of hundreds or thousands of tiny flowers called florets. The central florets look like the centre of a normal flower, and the outer florets look like yellow petals. All together they make up a \"false flower\" or pseudanthium. The benefit to the plant is that it is very easily seen by the insects and birds which pollinate it, and it produces thousands of seeds. The sunflower is the state flower of Kansas. That is why Kansas is sometimes called the Sunflower State. To grow well, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, wet, well-drained soil with a lot of mulch. In commercial planting, seeds are planted 45\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0ft) apart and 2.5\u00a0cm (1\u00a0in) deep."}

A philosopher who approached technology from a deterministic viewpoint. Ellul was professor at the University of Bordeaux. He authored some 40 books and hundreds of articles over his lifetime, the dominant theme of which has been the threat to human freedom and Christian faith created by modern technology. Ellul spoke often about the emergence of a \"technological tyranny\" over humanity.

People write on paper, and books are made of paper. Paper can absorb liquids such as water, so people can clean things with paper. The pulp and paper industry comprises companies that use wood as raw material and produce pulp, paper, board and other cellulose-based products.   Modern paper is normally made from wood pulp. Wood is ground up and mixed with water and other chemicals to make a thin liquid called \"paper pulp\". Paper pulp can be bleached to make paper more white, and dyes can be added to make colored paper. This pulp is pressed into sheets of paper. Printing is often done on paper before the paper is cut into sheets. Newsprint paper (newspaper) comes in a huge roll, and goes through the printing process as one continuous sheet. It is cut by a machine-driven guillotine blade later. Folding comes last, then packing for distribution. Sometimes paper is made heavier and more glossy (shiny) by adding clay, and by 'milling' it. Milling is done by squeezing the paper through a series of rollers. Sometimes paper is made from used or waste paper: this is recycling. Not all paper is made from wood. Other kinds of fiber can be used. People still make paper from cotton, linen and hemp for special purposes.  Writing started long before the invention of paper. People wrote on many kinds of material. They wrote on cloth, on stone walls, on wood. In Mesopotamia the Sumerians wrote on clay tablets, many of which have survived today. In Europe, people wrote on vellum.  Many centuries ago\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as early as the 3rd millennium BC (that's over 2000 BC)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0people in Egypt made a kind of paper from the papyrus plant. This is where the word 'paper' comes from. The people of Greece and Rome learned to do this too. The Romans wrote on parchment (made from animal skin), on waxed tablets and on wood (see Vindolanda). In China 105 AD, the eunuch Cai Lun told his Emperor he had made paper. They had previously used bamboo and silk. The material used in this ancient paper included cotton rags, hemp, various plant fibres and old fish nets. The oldest existing paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a watchtower in the Great Wall of China. It dates to about 150 AD.p5 Even earlier paper (but with no writing on it) has been claimed: \"The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world is made of hemp fibers, discovered in 1957 in a tomb near Xian, China, and dates from between the years 140 and 87 BC\". Paper-making was regarded by the Chinese as so valuable that they kept it secret as long as they could.  People in Japan learned how to make paper with fibres of the mulberry tree, around 610 AD. This is called Japanese paper or Washi. The Chinese invention spread to India, and then to the Middle East, and then to Italy. An opportunity occurred after The Battle of Talas in 751. Then an Arab army captured soldiers of the Chinese. There were some paper makers among the captured soldiers. From them, paper-making spread throughout the Islamic world. In 757, a paper mill was built at Samarkand. People learned to use linen as paper raw material and to use starch made from flour as an additive. The Italians used hemp and linen rags. In 1276 the first Italian paper mill was built at Fabriano and, until the 14 century, Italy was a paper supplier in Europe. In 1282 the first watermark was introduced in Bologna.  Paper was hard to make. It was cheaper than the old writing materials, but still expensive. A mechanical paper maker was conceived in France 1798, but invented in England. At least one paper mill was using them by 1812. Now the process was cheaper but the raw material was still expensive. In 1840 Friedrich Gottlob Keller Invented a machine that could make pulp for paper out of wood fibres (instead of the expensive rag paper). Paper became cheap enough for everyone to buy. Around the same time, other inventions were made, like the pencil, the fountain pen, and a printing press that used steam power. With this new information technology, people wrote more letters, made more books and newspapers, and kept more records of what they did. Today, some of the largest paper-producing countries are China, USA, Canada, Finland, Sweden and Russia. Paper is produced in large factories called paper mills. They produce hundreds of thousands of tons of paper each year.       Paper is used for writing and printing. Books, magazines and newspapers are printed on paper. Paper is often used for money. Paper used for money is often made in very special ways, to make it hard for people to print their own money. A piece of paper money is called a banknote, a bill or a note. Paper can be used for cleaning. Special forms of paper are used, such as paper towels, facial tissues or toilet paper. Pretty paper can be used as decoration. It can be pasted onto the walls of a room; this is called wallpaper. Paper can be used to wrap gifts. This is called wrapping paper or gift wrap. Some kinds of paper are strong and can be used in boxes and other packaging material. Sometimes several layers of paper are held together with glue, to make cardboard.

People wrote on many kinds of material. They wrote on cloth, on stone walls, on wood. In [[Mesopotamia]] the [[Sumer]]ians wrote on [[clay]] tablets, many of which have survived today. In Europe, people wrote on [[vellum]].\n\n=== First paper ===\nMany [[century|centuries]] ago&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;as early as the [[3rd millennium BC]] (that's over 2000 BC)&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;people in [[Egypt]] made a kind of paper from the [[papyrus]] plant.<ref name = Skeat>[http:\/\/www-user.uni-bremen.de\/~wie\/Egerton\/BellSkeat2.html H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. \"Papyrus and its uses\"] ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).<\/ref> This is where the word 'paper' comes from. The people of [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] learned to do this too. The Romans wrote on [[parchment]] (made from animal skin), on [[wax]]ed tablets and on wood (see [[Vindolanda]]).\n\nIn [[China]] 105 AD, the [[eunuch]] [[Cai Lun]] told his Emperor he had made paper. They had previously used [[bamboo]] and [[silk]].<ref>Han dynasty 206BC\u2013220 AD.<\/ref><ref name=Carter>Carter, Thomas Francis 1925. ''The invention of printing in China and its spread westward''. Columbia N.Y.<\/ref> The material used in this ancient paper included [[cotton]] [[wikt:rag|rags]], [[hemp]], various plant fibres and old [[Fishing net|fish nets]]. The oldest existing paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a watchtower in the [[Great Wall of China]]. It dates to about 150 AD.<ref name=Carter\/><sup>p5<\/sup><ref>Stein, M. Aurel 1921. ''Serindia''. London 1921.<\/ref><ref>Papermaking. 2007. In: ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', from ''Encyclopedia Britannica Online''.<\/ref> Even earlier paper (but with no writing on it) has been claimed: \"The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world is made of hemp fibers, discovered in 1957 in a tomb near Xian, China, and dates from between the years 140 and 87 BC\".<ref>Temple, Robert 1986. ''The genius of China: 3,000 Years of science, discovery, and invention''. Simon and Schuster, New York.<\/ref> Paper-making was regarded by the Chinese as so valuable that they kept it secret as long as they could.\n\n=== Spread of paper ===\nPeople in [[Japan]] learned how to make paper with fibres of the [[mulberry]] tree, around 610 AD. This is called Japanese paper or ''[[Washi]]''. The Chinese invention spread to [[India]], and then to the [[Middle East]], and then to [[Italy]].\n\nAn opportunity occurred after The Battle of Talas in 751. Then an [[Arab]] army captured soldiers of the Chinese. There were some paper makers among the captured soldiers. From them, paper-making spread throughout the [[Islamic world]].  In 757, a paper mill was built at [[Samarkand]]. People learned to use [[linen]] as paper raw material and to use starch made from [[flour]] as an additive.\n\nThe [[Italy|Italians]] used [[hemp]] and [[linen]] rags. In 1276 the first Italian paper mill was built at [[Fabriano]] and, until the 14 century, Italy was a paper supplier in Europe. In 1282 the first [[watermark]] was introduced in [[Bologna]].\n\n=== Machine-made paper ===\nPaper was hard to make. It was cheaper than the old writing materials, but still expensive. A mechanical paper maker was conceived in [[France]] 1798, but invented in [[England]]. At least one [[paper mill]] was using them by 1812.<ref>Hunter, Dard 1978. ''Paper-making: the history and technique of an ancient craft''. Courier Dover<\/ref><ref>Munsell, Joe 2009 [reprint of 1870 4th ed]. ''A chronology of paper and paper-making''. Albany.<\/ref> Now the process was cheaper but the [[raw material]] was still expensive.\n\nIn 1840 Friedrich Gottlob Keller Invented a machine that could make pulp for paper out of [[wood]] fibres (instead of the expensive rag paper). Paper became cheap enough for everyone to buy. Around the same time, other [[invention]]s were made, like the [[pencil]], the [[fountain pen]], and a [[printing press]] that used [[steam power]]. With this new [[information technology]], people wrote more letters, made more books and [[newspaper]]s, and kept more records of what they did.\n\nToday, some of the largest paper-producing countries are [[China]], [[USA]], [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Russia]]. Paper is produced in large factories called ''paper mills''. They produce hundreds of thousands of tons of paper each year.\n\n== Uses of paper ==\n[[File:Making Paper.gif|thumb|right|200px|Making Chinese paper]]\n\nPaper is used for [[write|writing]] and [[wikt:print|printing]]. Books, [[magazine]]s and [[newspaper]]s are printed on paper.\n\nPaper is often used for [[money]]. Paper used for money is often made in very special ways, to make it hard for people to print their own money. A piece of paper money is called a [[banknote]], a bill or a note.\n\nPaper can be used for cleaning. Special forms of paper are used, such as [[paper towel]]s, [[facial tissue]]s or [[toilet paper]].\n\nPretty paper can be used as [[decoration]]. It can be pasted onto the walls of a room; this is called [[wallpaper]]. Paper can be used to wrap gifts. This is called [[wrapping paper]] or [[gift wrap]].\n\nSome kinds of paper are strong and can be used in [[box]]es and other [[container|packaging]] [[material]]. Sometimes several layers of paper are held together with [[glue]], to make [[cardboard]].\n\n==Related pages==\n* [[Paper size]]\n* [[Cardboard]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]\n[[Category:Paper| ]]\n[[Category:Writing tools]]","opening_text":"Modern paper is a thin material of (mostly) wood fibres pressed together.

As of now, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. With time, the different symptoms of the disease become more marked. Many people die because of Alzheimer's disease. The disease affects different parts of the brain but has its worst effects on the areas of the brain that control memory, language, and thinking skills. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of senile dementia accounting for up to 70% of cases. The clinical symptoms of AD usually occurs after age 65, but changes in the brain which do not cause symptoms and are caused by Alzheimer's, may begin years or in some cases decades before. Although the symptoms of AD begin in older people it is not a normal part of aging. At this time there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but there are treatments that can help some patients with the signs and symptoms so they do not affect them as badly. There are also treatments which slow down the disease so the damage to the brain does not happen as quickly. There are also certain personal habits that people can learn which may help to delay the onset of the disease. While it is not yet known exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease, there are a number of risk factors which may make a person more likely to get it. Some of these risk factors are genetic; changes to four different genes have been found which increase the risk. The current lifetime risk for a 65-year-old person to get Alzheimer's disease is estimated to be at 10.5%. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States causing about 83,500 deaths a year. In 2007, there were more than 26.6 million people throughout the world who were affected by AD. Alzheimer's disease was named after Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist who first described the disease after studying the case of a middle-aged woman, Auguste Deter, who was a patient at a hospital in Frankfurt, Germany in 1906. The disease was named Alzheimer's disease in 1910 by Dr. Emil Kraepilin a co-worker of Alzheimer.                        Two of the main features found in the brains of people with of Alzheimer's disease, are neurobrillary tangles ('tangles' for short), which are made up of a protein called tau, and senile plaques (which are made mostly from another protein called beta-amyloid, they are also sometimes called beta-amyloid bundles or 'bundles' for short). The tau proteins that form the tangles previously held together a structure inside the neurons called a microtubule which is an important part of the neuron; it forms part of the cytoskeleton (cell skeleton) which is what maintains a cell's shape, and microtubules plays a part in cell communication. Both tangles and plaques may be caused by other diseases, such as Herpes simplex virus Type 1 which is being investigated as a possible cause or contributor in developing Alzheimer's. It is not known for sure if tangles and plaques are part of what causes Alzheimer's, or if they are the results. Microtubules  Microtubules are made of a protein called tubulin. The tubulin is polymerized, which is when molecules form the same shapes over and over again that are linked together in groups, and these groups are linked together. They can form long chains or other shapes; in this case the polymerized tubulin forms microtubules. The microtubules are rigid tubes like microscopic straws which are hollow inside. Microtubules help keep the shape of the neuron, and are inolved in passing signals through the neuron. Tau  Tau is a protein that is found mostly in the neurons of the central nervous system. They help hold together the microtubules within the neurons. and when changes happen in the way the tau proteins are supposed to work the microtubules break apart. The tau proteins which are no longer holding the microtubules together form strands called fibrils, which then clump together inside the neuron to make what are called neurofibrillary tangles . These clumps, also known as 'tau tangles', are all that remain after a neuron has died. Beta-amyloid  Beta-amyloid(A\u03b2) (also called 'amyloid beta') plaques start with a protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is one of the proteins that make up a cell's membrane or outer covering, that protects the cell. In this case a neuron.. As it is made inside the cell, APP sticks out through the membrane of the cell.             In different parts of the of cell including the outermost part of the cell membrane, chemicals called enzymes snip the APP into small pieces. These enzymes that do the snipping are alpha-secretase, beta-secretase, and gamma-secretase. Depending on which enzyme is doing the snipping and what parts of the APP are snipped, two different things can happen. One that is helpful and one that causes the formation of beta-amyloid plaques. The plaques are formed when beta-secretase snips the APP molecule at one end of the beta-amyloid peptide, releasing sAPP\u03b2 from the cell. Gamma-secretase then cuts the pieces of APP that is left and, still sticking out of the neuron\u2019s membrane, at the other end of the beta-amyloid peptide. After this snipping the beta-amyloid peptide is released into the space outside the neuron and begins to stick to other beta-amyloid peptides. These pieces stick together to form oligomers. Different oligomers of various sizes are now floating around in the spaces between the neurons, which may be responsible for reacting with receptors on neighboring cells and synapses, affecting their ability to function. Some of these oligomers are cleared from the brain. Those that are not cleared out clump together with more pieces of beta-amyloid. As more pieces clump togther the oligomers get bigger larger, and the next size up are called protofibrils and the next size after that are called fibrils. After a while, these fibrils clump together with other protein molecules, neurons and non-nerve cells floating around in the space between the cells and form what are called plaques. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) Deposits of beta-amyloid also form in the walls (in the tunica media, the middle layer, and tunica adventitia or tunica externa, the outer layer) of small and mid-sized arteries (and sometimes veins) in the cerebral cortex and the leptomeninges (the leptomeninges are the two inner layers - pia mater and arachnoid - of the meninges, a protective 3-layer membrane covering the brain.) CAA is found in 30% of people over the age of 60 years who do not have any dementia but is found in 90%-96% of people with Alzheimer disease and is severe in one third to two thirds of these cases.       The first area of the brain to be affected by Alzheimer's is the \"transentorhinal region\" which is part of the medial temporal lobe located deep within the brain. Neurons start dying in this area first. It then spreads into the adjacent entorhinal cortex (EC) which acts as a central hub, for a widespread network that handles signals for memory and movement(like a main train station with train tracks going to different areas).      The EC is the main area for communication between the hippocampus, and the neocortex - which is the outer portion of the brain responsible for higher functioning such as how the brain perceives information from the five senses; (smell, sight, taste, touch and hearing; Ex. seeing a person's face and recognizing them,) generating motor commands (Ex, moving and arm or leg, walking, running) spatial reasoning, conscious thought and language. The disease then spreads into the hippocampus which is part of the limbic system. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is involved in forming new memories, organizing them, and storing them for later recall. It is also where emotions and senses, such as smell and sound are attached to specific memories. Example 1.: A memory might make you happy or sad. Example 2.: A smell might bring up a certain memory. The hippocampus then sends memories to the different parts of the cerebral hemisphere where they are placed in long-term storage and it helps retrieve them when necessary. Example: An adult trying to remember the name of a classmate from kindergarten. In addition to handling memory the hippocampus is also involved in emotional responses, navigation (getting around) and spatial orientation (knowing your sense of place as you move around Example: Knowing your way around your bedroom even with the lights off). There are actually two parts of the hippocampus which is shaped like a horseshoe with one in the left part of the brain and the other in the right part of the brain.       Preclinical  Red Blue Green Purple Orange Purple Orange Green Blue Red Blue Orange Purple Green Red Purple Green Red Blue Orange The Stroop Color\u2013Word Test This is a short example of the test. The test is used to measure different cognitive functions such as selective attention. Naming the colors of the first set of words is easier and quicker than the second, because in the first set, the colors match the words, in the second set they do not. So a person has to pay more attention. People having problems with attention as may happen in early-stage Alzheimer's tend to do poorly on this test. With current research using advances in neuroimaging such as FDG-PET and PIB-PET scans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays, it is now possible to detect the beginning processes of Alzheimer's disease that occur before symptoms begin. The research suggests that clinically normal older people (no symptoms at all) have biomarker evidence of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) build-up in the brain. This amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is linked to changes in the structure of the brain and how it works that is the similar to what is seen in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - which may lead to Alzheimer's - and people with Alzheimer's. These small preclinical changes (no symptoms) in the brain may occur many years, to even a few decades before a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. With a stage where there is some memory loss, or mild cognitive impairment. These changes put a person at risk of developing the clinical symptoms of full-blown Alzheimer's but not everyone who has these changes will get the disease. Even though there is no cure for Alzheimer's, there are new treatments which are being developed which would work better in the very first stages of the disease. At this time exactly what makes up the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's is still being researched, such as why some people with go on to develop Alzheimer's and others do not. So the term preclinical phase is being used for research only. There is a worldwide effort in various countries doing research in this area known as the World Wide Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) which is the umbrella organization for neuroimaging studies being carried out through the North American ADNI, European ADNI (E-ADNI), Japan ADNI, Australian ADNI (AIBL), Taiwan ADNI, Korea ADNI, China ADNI and Argentina ADNI. Beginning stages \"Misdiagnosis in very early stages of Alzheimer's is a significant problem, as there are more than 100 conditions that can mimic the disease. In people with mild memory complaints, our accuracy is barely better than chance,\" according to study researcher P. Murali Doraiswamy, MBBS, professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke Medicine, \"Given that the definitive gold standard for diagnosing Alzheimer's is autopsy, we need a better way to look into the brain.\"                   In 1901, a 51-year-old woman named Auguste Deter, was committed to the City Asylum for the Insane and Epileptic, (St\u00e4dtischen Anstalt f\u00fcr Irre und Epileptische) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany which had the nickname \"Irrenschloss\" (Castle of the Insane). She was married and had a normal life until eight months prior to her commitment, when she started having psychological and neurological problems, such as problems with memory and language, paranoia, becoming disorientated and having hallucinations. She was studied by a doctor on staff named Alois Alzheimer (1864\u20131915). Alzheimer became interested in her case because of her age; while the effects of senile dementia were known at the time, they usually did not start until a person was in their early to mid-sixties. Her case was also notable because of the rapid onset of dementia, only eight months, from the first reported symptoms, until she was committed. While conducting one of his examinations of Ms. Deter, he asked her to perform a series of simple writing tasks. Unable to do what was asked such as write her name, she said \"I have lost myself, so to speak\" (\"Ich habe mich sozusagen selbst verloren\"). Alzheimer left the hospital in Franfkurt in 1902 to begin working with Emil Kraepelin at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Heidelberg-Bergheim, and in 1903 both he and Kraepelin began working at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. When Ms. Deter died of septicemia on 8 April 1906, Alzheimer was informed and her brain was sent to Munich for him to study. Studying samples of her brain under a microscope he noticed neurofibriallry tangles and bundles made up of beta-amyloid plaque, which are two of the main features of the disease. On 3 November 1906, Alzheimer presented the results of his findings in Auguste's case at the Conference of South-West German Psychiatrists in T\u00fcbingen, and he published his findings in the case in 1907. In 1910, Emil Kraepelin named the disease 'Alzheimer's disease'. Alzheimer's disease usually beigins affecting people between ages 60\u201365, in Ms. Deter's case - who was 55-years-old when she died - she had a form of what is now known as Early-onset Alzhiemer's disease.       Anyone can get Alzheimer's disease, rich people or poor famous people and unfamous people. Some of the famous people who have gotten Alzheimer's disease are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch, both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities got worse with the disease. Other cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, the former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (United Kingdom) and Adolfo Su\u00e1rez (Spain), the actress Rita Hayworth, the Nobel Prize-winner Raymond Davis, Jr., the actor Charlton Heston, the novelist Terry Pratchett, politician and activist Sargent Shriver, the Blues musician B.B. King, director Jacques Rivette, Indian politician George Fernandes, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. Kao. In 2012, Nobel Prize writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was diagnosed with the disease.   Brookmeyer R, Johnson E, Ziegler-Graha K, Arrighi HM.

As of now, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. With time, the different symptoms of  the disease become more marked. Many people die because of Alzheimer's disease. The disease affects different parts of the brain but has its worst effects on the areas of the brain that control memory, language, and thinking skills. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of senile [[dementia]] accounting for up to 70% of cases.\n\nThe clinical symptoms of AD usually occurs after age 65, but changes in the brain which do not cause symptoms and are caused by Alzheimer's, may begin years or in some cases decades before. Although the symptoms of AD begin in older people it is not a normal part of [[aging]].\n\nAt this time there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but there are treatments that can help some patients with the signs and symptoms so they do not affect them as badly. There are also treatments which slow down the disease so the damage to the brain does not happen as quickly. There are also certain personal habits that people can learn which may help to delay the onset of the [[disease]].\n\nWhile it is not yet known exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease, there are a number of [[Factor (medicine)|risk factors]] which may make a person more likely to get it. Some of these risk factors are genetic; changes to four different genes have been found which increase the risk.\n\nThe current lifetime risk for a 65-year-old person to get Alzheimer's disease is estimated to be at 10.5%. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States causing about 83,500 deaths a year. In 2007, there were more than 26.6 million people throughout the world who were affected by AD.<ref>Brookmeyer R, Johnson E, Ziegler-Graha K, Arrighi HM.

The tau proteins that form the tangles previously held together a structure inside the neurons called a ''microtubule'' which is an important part of the neuron; it forms part of the ''cytoskeleton'' (cell skeleton) which is what maintains a cell's shape, and microtubules plays a part in cell communication.<ref>Roger M.

It is not known for sure if tangles and plaques are part of what causes Alzheimer's, or if they are the results.\n\n'''Microtubules'''\n[[File:Kinesin cartoon.png|90px]]\n\nMicrotubules are made of a protein called ''tubulin''. The tubulin is ''polymerized'', which is when molecules form the same shapes over and over again that are linked together in groups, and these groups are linked together. They can form long chains or other shapes; in this case the polymerized tubulin forms microtubules. The microtubules are rigid tubes like microscopic straws which are hollow inside. Microtubules help keep the shape of the neuron, and are inolved in passing signals through the neuron.<ref>Cooper GM: The Cell: A Molecular Approach. 2nd edition.

They help hold together the ''microtubules'' within the neurons.  and when changes happen in the way the tau proteins are supposed to work the microtubules break apart. The tau proteins which are no longer holding the microtubules together form strands called ''fibrils'', which then clump together inside the neuron to make what are called neurofibrillary tangles . These clumps, also known as 'tau tangles', are all that remain after a neuron has died.<ref>David Ames, Alistair Burns, John O'Brien:  Dementia 3Ed ,(Hodder Arnold Publication), CRC Press; 3 edition (2005) pp.408-410.

APP is one of the proteins that make up a cell's membrane or outer covering, that protects the cell. In this case a neuron.. As it is made inside the cell, APP sticks out through the membrane of the cell.\n{{multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = vertical\n | image1    = Illu artery.jpg\n | width1    = 170\n | caption1  = The arterial wall has three layers.

The beta-amyloid deposits show up as black 'dots' spread throughout the brain's outer layer, the ''cerebral cortex''.  \n}}\nIn different parts of the of cell including the outermost part of the cell membrane, chemicals called enzymes snip the APP into small pieces.  These enzymes that do the snipping are alpha-secretase, beta-secretase, and gamma-secretase.  Depending on which enzyme is doing the snipping and what parts of the APP are snipped, two different things can happen. One that is helpful and one that causes the formation of beta-amyloid plaques.\n\nThe plaques are formed when beta-secretase snips the APP molecule at one end of the beta-amyloid peptide, releasing sAPP\u03b2 from the cell. Gamma-secretase then cuts the pieces of APP that is left and, still sticking out of the neuron\u2019s membrane, at the other end of the beta-amyloid peptide. After this snipping the beta-amyloid peptide is released into the space outside the neuron and begins to stick to other beta-amyloid peptides. These pieces stick together to form ''oligomers''. Different oligomers of various sizes are now floating around in the spaces between the neurons, which may be responsible for reacting with receptors on neighboring cells and synapses, affecting their ability to function.\n\nSome of these oligomers are cleared from the brain. Those that are not cleared out clump together with more pieces of beta-amyloid. As more pieces clump togther the oligomers get bigger larger, and the next size up are called ''protofibrils'' and the next size after that are called fibrils. After a while, these fibrils clump together with other protein molecules, neurons and non-nerve cells floating around in the space between the cells and form what are called plaques.\n\n'''Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)'''\n\nDeposits of beta-amyloid also form in the walls (in the ''tunica media'', the middle layer, and  ''tunica adventitia'' or ''tunica externa'', the outer layer) of small and mid-sized arteries (and sometimes veins) in the cerebral cortex and the ''leptomeninges'' (the ''leptomeninges'' are the two inner layers - pia mater and arachnoid - of the ''meninges'', a protective 3-layer membrane covering the brain.)\n\nCAA is found in 30% of people over the age of 60 years who do not have any dementia but is found in 90%-96% of people with Alzheimer disease and is severe in one third to two thirds of these cases.<ref>Weller RO, Preston SD, Subash M, Carare RO.

The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is involved in forming new memories, organizing them, and storing them for later recall. It is also where emotions and senses, such as smell and sound are attached to specific memories. Example 1.: A memory might make you happy or sad. Example 2.: A smell might bring up a certain memory.\n\nThe hippocampus then sends memories to the different parts of the cerebral hemisphere where they are placed in long-term storage and it helps retrieve them when necessary. Example: An adult trying to remember the name of a classmate from kindergarten.\n\nIn addition to handling memory the hippocampus is also involved in emotional responses, navigation (getting around) and spatial orientation (knowing your sense of place as you move around Example: Knowing your way around your bedroom even with the lights off).\n\nThere are actually two parts of the hippocampus which is shaped like a horseshoe with one in the left part of the brain and the other in the right part of the brain.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:PiB PET Images AD.jpg|thumb|right|170px|This PiB-PET scan shows a lot of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) in the brain of a person with Alzheimer's.

The research suggests that clinically normal older people (no symptoms at all) have ''biomarker'' evidence of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) build-up in the brain. This amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is linked to changes in the structure of the brain and how it works that is the similar to what is seen in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - which may lead to Alzheimer's - and people with Alzheimer's.\n\nThese small preclinical changes (no symptoms) in the brain may occur many years, to even a few decades before a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. With a stage where there is some memory loss, or mild cognitive impairment. These changes put a person at risk of developing the clinical symptoms of full-blown  Alzheimer's but not everyone who has these changes will get the disease. Even though there is no cure for Alzheimer's, there are new treatments which are being developed which would work better in the very first stages of the disease.<ref>Sperling RA, Aisen PS, Beckett LA, ''et al.''

So the term ''preclinical phase'' is being used for research only.

She was married and had a normal life until eight months prior to her commitment, when she started having psychological and neurological problems, such as problems with memory and language, paranoia, becoming disorientated and having hallucinations.\n\nShe was studied by a doctor on staff named Alois Alzheimer (1864\u20131915).  Alzheimer became interested in her case because of her age; while the effects of senile dementia were known at the time, they usually did not start until a person was in their early to mid-sixties. Her case was also notable because of the rapid onset of dementia, only eight months, from the first reported symptoms, until she was committed.\n\nWhile conducting one of his examinations of Ms. Deter, he asked her to perform a series of simple writing tasks. Unable to do what was asked such as write her name, she said \"I have lost myself, so to speak\" (\"''Ich habe mich sozusagen selbst verloren''\").\n\nAlzheimer left the hospital in Franfkurt in 1902 to begin working with Emil Kraepelin at the Psychiatric University Hospital in [[Heidelberg|Heidelberg-Bergheim]], and in 1903 both he and Kraepelin began working at Ludwig Maximilian University in [[Munich]].\n\nWhen Ms. Deter died of [[septicemia]] on 8 April 1906, Alzheimer was informed and her brain was sent to Munich for him to study. Studying samples of her brain under a microscope he noticed neurofibriallry tangles and bundles made up of beta-amyloid plaque, which are two of the main features of the disease.  On 3 November 1906, Alzheimer presented the results of his findings in Auguste's case at the Conference of South-West German Psychiatrists in T\u00fcbingen, and he published his findings in the case in 1907.\n\nIn 1910, Emil Kraepelin named the disease 'Alzheimer's disease'. Alzheimer's disease usually beigins affecting people between ages 60\u201365, in Ms. Deter's case - who was 55-years-old when she died - she had a form of what is now known as ''Early-onset Alzhiemer's disease''.<ref>Shelley J.

As of now, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. With time, the different symptoms of the disease become more marked. Many people die because of Alzheimer's disease. The disease affects different parts of the brain but has its worst effects on the areas of the brain that control memory, language, and thinking skills. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of senile dementia accounting for up to 70% of cases. The clinical symptoms of AD usually occurs after age 65, but changes in the brain which do not cause symptoms and are caused by Alzheimer's, may begin years or in some cases decades before. Although the symptoms of AD begin in older people it is not a normal part of aging. At this time there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but there are treatments that can help some patients with the signs and symptoms so they do not affect them as badly. There are also treatments which slow down the disease so the damage to the brain does not happen as quickly. There are also certain personal habits that people can learn which may help to delay the onset of the disease. While it is not yet known exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease, there are a number of risk factors which may make a person more likely to get it. Some of these risk factors are genetic; changes to four different genes have been found which increase the risk. The current lifetime risk for a 65-year-old person to get Alzheimer's disease is estimated to be at 10.5%. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States causing about 83,500 deaths a year. In 2007, there were more than 26.6 million people throughout the world who were affected by AD. Alzheimer's disease was named after Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist who first described the disease after studying the case of a middle-aged woman, Auguste Deter, who was a patient at a hospital in Frankfurt, Germany in 1906. The disease was named Alzheimer's disease in 1910 by Dr. Emil Kraepilin a co-worker of Alzheimer.","language":"en","wikibase_item":"Q11081","version":5547028,"version_type":"external","popularity_score":5.3521754201685e-5,"coordinates":[],"wiki":"simplewiki","defaultsort":false}

There are written records of the history of China which date from 1500 BC in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BC). China is one of the world's oldest continuous (still alive) civilizations. Turtle shells with writing like ancient Chinese writing from the Shang Dynasty (Chinese: \u5546\u671d) have been carbon dated to about 1500 BC. They say that China began as city-states in the Yellow River valley. Many people say that China became a big Kingdom or Empire in 221 BC. The Qin (Chinese: \u79e6) emperor Qin Shi Huang made everyone write the same way. He also had ideas about the state which he based on legalism and fought Confucianism. This began what we call the Chinese civilization. Ancient China fought wars and Civil wars and was also sometimes conquered by other people. Chinese civilization originated in various regional centers along both the Yellow River and the Yangtze River valleys in the Neolithic era, but the Yellow River is said to be the cradle of Chinese civilization. With thousands of years of continuous history, China is one of the world's oldest civilizations. The written history of China can be found as early as the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 \u2013 1046 BC) although ancient historical texts such as the Records of the Grand Historian (ca. 100 BC) and Bamboo Annals say that a Xia Dynasty existed before the Shang. Much of Chinese culture, literature and philosophy further developed during the Zhou Dynasty (1045 \u2013 256 BC). The Zhou Dynasty began to bow to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC, and the kingdom eventually broke apart into smaller states, beginning in the Spring and Autumn Period and reaching full expression in the Warring States period. This is one of multiple periods of failed statehood in Chinese history (the most recent of which was the Chinese Civil War). In between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, Chinese dynasties have ruled parts or all of China; in some eras, including the present, control has stretched as far as Xinjiang and\/or Tibet. This practice began with the Qin Dynasty: in 221 BC, Qin Shi Huang united the various warring kingdoms and created the first Chinese empire. Successive dynasties in Chinese history developed bureaucratic systems that enabled the Emperor of China to directly control vast territories. The conventional view of Chinese history is that of alternating periods of political unity and disunity, with China occasionally being dominated by steppe peoples, most of whom were in turn assimilated into the Han Chinese population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of Asia, carried by successive waves of immigration, expansion, and cultural assimilation, are part of the modern culture of China.  3 Sovereigns and 5 Emperors: 50,000 \u2013 2000 BC Xia Dynasty: c. 2000 \u2013 c. 1600 BC Shang Dynasty (or Yin Dynasty): c. 1600 \u2013 1046 BC Zhou Dynasty Western Zhou: 1046 \u2013 771 BC Eastern Zhou Spring and Autumn period: 771 \u2013 481 BC Warring States period: 481 \u2013 221 BC   Qin Dynasty: 221 \u2013 206 BC Han Dynasty: 206 BC \u2013 220 AD Western Han: 206 BC \u2013 8 AD Xin Dynasty: 8 \u2013 23 AD  Three Kingdoms The Kingdom of Wei: 220 \u2013 265 AD The Kingdom of Shu: 221 \u2013 263 AD The Kingdom of Wu: 229 \u2013 280 AD  Jin Dynasty Western Jin: 265 \u2013 316 AD Eastern Jin: 317 \u2013 460 AD  The Sixteen Kingdoms \"Former Zhao\" or \"Han Zhao\": 304 \u2013 329 AD \"Cheng Han\" or \"Former Shu\": 306 \u2013 347 AD Former Liang: 314 \u2013 376 AD \"Later Zhao\" or \"Shi Zhao\": 319 \u2013 351 AD Former Yan: 334 \u2013 370 AD \"Former Qin\" or \"Fu Qin\": 351 \u2013 394 AD Later Yan: 384 \u2013 409 AD \"Later Qin\" or \"Iau Qin\": 384 \u2013 417 AD Western Qin: 385 \u2013 431 AD \"Later Liang\" or \"Lu Liang\": 389 \u2013 403 AD Southern Liang: 397 \u2013 414 AD Southern Yan: 398 \u2013 410 AD Western Liang: 400 \u2013 421 AD Northern Liang: 401 \u2013 439 AD \"Xia\" or \"Hu Xia\": 407 \u2013 431 AD \"Northern Yan\" or \"Feng Yan\": 409 \u2013 436 AD  The countries below are not included in the sixteen kingdoms:  Former Chouchi: 296 \u2013 371 AD Later Chouchi: 385 \u2013 443 AD Dai: 315 \u2013 376 AD Ran Wei: 350 \u2013 352 AD Western Yan: 384 \u2013 394 AD Zhai Wei: 388 \u2013 392 AD Western Shu: 405 \u2013 413 AD Yuwenbu: 302 \u2013 344 AD Duanbu: 310 \u2013 357 AD Tuguhun: 313 \u2013 633 AD  Southern and Northern Dynasties Southern Dynasties Song: 420 \u2013 479 AD Chi: 479 \u2013 502 AD Liang: 502 \u2013 557 AD Chen: 557 \u2013 589 AD  Northern Dynasties Northern Wei: 386 \u2013 534 AD Eastern Wei: 534 \u2013 550 AD Western Wei: 535 \u2013 557 AD Northern Chi: 550 \u2013 557 AD Northern Chou: 557 \u2013 581 AD   Sui Dynasty: 581 \u2013 618 AD Tang Dynasty: 618 \u2013 907 AD Tang Dynasty had been interrupted by Wu Chou: 690 \u2013 705 AD  Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Five Dynasties Later Liang: 907 \u2013 923 AD Later Tang: 923 \u2013 936 AD Later Jin: 936 \u2013 947 AD Later Han: 947 \u2013 950 AD Later Chou: 951 \u2013 960 AD  Ten Kingdoms Wu Yue: 904 \u2013 978 AD Min (changed its name to Yin at 943 AD): 909 \u2013 945 AD Jinnan: 907 \u2013 963 AD Chu: 897 \u2013 951 AD Wu: 904 \u2013 973 AD Southern Tang: 937 \u2013 975 AD Southern Han: 917 \u2013 971 AD Northern Han: 951 \u2013 979 AD Former Shu: 907 \u2013 925 AD Later Shu: 934 \u2013 965 AD  And other regimes Dingnan Jiedu: 881 \u2013 982 AD Fongshang Jiedu (or Chi): 887 \u2013 924 AD Lulong Jiedu (or Yan): 897 \u2013 913 AD Chender Jiedu (or Zhao): 883 \u2013 921 AD Yiwu Jiedu: 900(?) \u2013 922 AD and 928 \u2013 929 AD Wuping Jiedu (or Hunan Jiedu): 950 \u2013 963 AD Chinyuan Jiedu: 946 \u2013 978 AD Hexi Regime:\u00a0?

The written history of China can be found as early as the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 \u2013 1046 BC) although ancient historical texts such as the Records of the Grand Historian (ca. 100 BC) and Bamboo Annals say that a Xia Dynasty existed before the Shang. Much of Chinese culture, literature and philosophy further developed during the Zhou Dynasty (1045 \u2013 256 BC).\n\nThe Zhou Dynasty began to bow to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC, and the kingdom eventually broke apart into smaller states, beginning in the Spring and Autumn Period and reaching full expression in the Warring States period. This is one of multiple periods of failed statehood in Chinese history (the most recent of which was the Chinese Civil War).\n\nIn between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, Chinese dynasties have ruled parts or all of China; in some eras, including the present, control has stretched as far as [[Xinjiang]] and\/or [[Tibet]]. This practice began with the Qin Dynasty: in 221 BC, Qin Shi Huang united the various warring kingdoms and created the first Chinese empire. Successive dynasties in Chinese history developed bureaucratic systems that enabled the Emperor of China to directly control vast territories.\n\nThe conventional view of Chinese history is that of alternating periods of political unity and disunity, with China occasionally being dominated by steppe peoples, most of whom were in turn assimilated into the Han Chinese population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of Asia, carried by successive waves of immigration, expansion, and cultural assimilation, are part of the modern culture of China.\n\n==Timeline==\n*[[3 Sovereigns and 5 Emperors]]: 50,000 \u2013 2000 BC\n*[[Xia Dynasty]]: c. 2000 \u2013 c. 1600 BC\n*[[Shang Dynasty]] (or Yin Dynasty): c. 1600 \u2013 1046 BC\n*[[Zhou Dynasty]]\n**Western Zhou: 1046 \u2013 771 BC\n**Eastern Zhou\n***Spring and Autumn period: 771 \u2013 481 BC\n***Warring States period: 481 \u2013 221 BC\n*[[Qin Dynasty]]: 221 \u2013 206 BC\n*[[Han Dynasty]]: 206 BC \u2013 220 AD\n**Western Han: 206 BC \u2013 8 AD\n**Xin Dynasty: 8 \u2013 23 AD\n*Three Kingdoms\n**The Kingdom of Wei: 220 \u2013 265 AD\n**The Kingdom of Shu: 221 \u2013 263 AD\n**The Kingdom of Wu: 229 \u2013 280 AD\n*[[Jin Dynasty]]\n**Western Jin: 265 \u2013 316 AD\n**Eastern Jin: 317 \u2013 460 AD\n*The Sixteen Kingdoms\n**\"Former Zhao\" or \"Han Zhao\": 304 \u2013 329 AD\n**\"Cheng Han\" or \"Former Shu\": 306 \u2013 347 AD\n**Former Liang: 314 \u2013 376 AD\n**\"Later Zhao\" or \"Shi Zhao\": 319 \u2013 351 AD\n**Former Yan: 334 \u2013 370 AD\n**\"Former Qin\" or \"Fu Qin\": 351 \u2013 394 AD\n**Later Yan: 384 \u2013 409 AD\n**\"Later Qin\" or \"Iau Qin\": 384 \u2013 417 AD\n**Western Qin: 385 \u2013 431 AD\n**\"Later Liang\" or \"Lu Liang\": 389 \u2013 403 AD\n**Southern Liang: 397 \u2013 414 AD\n**Southern Yan: 398 \u2013 410 AD\n**Western Liang: 400 \u2013 421 AD\n**Northern Liang: 401 \u2013 439 AD\n**\"Xia\" or \"Hu Xia\": 407 \u2013 431 AD\n**\"Northern Yan\" or \"Feng Yan\": 409 \u2013 436 AD\nThe countries below are not included in the sixteen kingdoms:\n**Former Chouchi:  296 \u2013 371 AD\n**Later Chouchi: 385 \u2013 443 AD\n**Dai: 315 \u2013 376 AD\n**Ran Wei: 350 \u2013 352 AD\n**Western Yan: 384 \u2013 394 AD\n**Zhai Wei: 388 \u2013 392 AD\n**Western Shu: 405 \u2013 413 AD\n**Yuwenbu: 302 \u2013 344 AD\n**Duanbu: 310 \u2013 357 AD\n**Tuguhun:  313 \u2013 633 AD\n*Southern and Northern Dynasties\n**Southern Dynasties\n***Song: 420 \u2013 479 AD\n***Chi: 479 \u2013 502 AD\n***Liang: 502 \u2013 557 AD\n***Chen: 557 \u2013 589 AD\n**Northern Dynasties\n***Northern Wei: 386 \u2013 534 AD\n***Eastern Wei: 534 \u2013 550 AD\n***Western Wei: 535 \u2013 557 AD\n***Northern Chi: 550 \u2013 557 AD\n***Northern Chou: 557 \u2013 581 AD\n*[[Sui Dynasty]]: 581 \u2013 618 AD\n*[[Tang Dynasty]]: 618 \u2013 907 AD\n**Tang Dynasty had been interrupted by Wu Chou: 690 \u2013 705 AD\n*Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms\n**Five Dynasties\n***Later Liang: 907 \u2013 923 AD\n***Later Tang: 923 \u2013 936 AD\n***Later Jin: 936 \u2013 947 AD\n***Later Han: 947 \u2013 950 AD\n***Later Chou: 951 \u2013 960 AD\n**Ten Kingdoms\n***Wu Yue: 904 \u2013 978 AD\n***Min (changed its name to Yin at 943 AD): 909 \u2013 945 AD\n***Jinnan: 907 \u2013 963 AD\n***Chu: 897 \u2013 951 AD\n***Wu: 904 \u2013 973 AD\n***Southern Tang: 937 \u2013 975 AD\n***Southern Han: 917 \u2013 971 AD\n***Northern Han: 951 \u2013 979 AD\n***Former Shu: 907 \u2013 925 AD\n***Later Shu: 934 \u2013 965 AD\n**And other regimes\n***Dingnan Jiedu: 881 \u2013 982 AD\n***Fongshang Jiedu (or Chi): 887 \u2013 924 AD\n***Lulong Jiedu (or Yan): 897 \u2013 913 AD\n***Chender Jiedu (or Zhao): 883 \u2013 921 AD\n***Yiwu Jiedu: 900(?) \u2013 922 AD and 928 \u2013 929 AD\n***Wuping Jiedu (or Hunan Jiedu): 950 \u2013 963 AD\n***Chinyuan Jiedu: 946 \u2013 978 AD\n***Hexi Regime: ?\n*[[Song Dynasty]]\n**Northern Song: 960 \u2013 1127 AD\n**Southern Song: 1127 \u2013 1279 AD\n*[[Liao Dynasty]] (or Khitan) - 907 \u2013 1125 AD\n**After the Gin Dynasty ends the Liao Dynasty, Yel\u00fc Dashi, an aristocrat of Liao, rebuilded the Liao Dynasty, we call it Western Liao, also known as Kara-Khitan Khanate: 1132 \u2013 1218 AD\n*[[Gin Dynasty]]: 1115 \u2013 1234 AD\n*Western Xia: 1038 \u2013 1227 AD\n*[[Yuan Dynasty]] (Actually the Mongolia): 1279 \u2013 1368 AD\n*[[Ming Dynasty]]: 1368 \u2013 1644 AD\n*[[Qing Dynasty]]: 1636 \u2013 1912 AD\n*[[The Republic of China]]: 1912 AD \u2013 now (It only ruled mainland China until 1949.

There are written records of the history of China which date from 1500 BC in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BC). China is one of the world's oldest continuous (still alive) civilizations. Turtle shells with writing like ancient Chinese writing from the Shang Dynasty (Chinese: \u5546\u671d) have been carbon dated to about 1500 BC. They say that China began as city-states in the Yellow River valley. Many people say that China became a big Kingdom or Empire in 221 BC. The Qin (Chinese: \u79e6) emperor Qin Shi Huang made everyone write the same way. He also had ideas about the state which he based on legalism and fought Confucianism. This began what we call the Chinese civilization. Ancient China fought wars and Civil wars and was also sometimes conquered by other people.

The relationship between the client and the server is called a client-server relationship. For example, Wikipedia has a web server which has a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to the Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you. A server can also host internet games and allow file sharing. In simple words, the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers. These store files and information in the form of website. These files can be accessed by different users anywhere from the world using an internet connection. So that servers and clients can talk to each other, they need to be connected to a network, and they need to use the same protocol. In networks, a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines. It is just like a language. For example, the Wikipedia server runs the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to send web sites to your computer, and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages. Usually, servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable, and they are much more expensive than normal computers.

It is also the largest city in both Ontario and Canada. Found on the north-west side of Lake Ontario, the City of Toronto has a population of over 3 million people and even more people live in the regions around it. All together, the Greater Toronto Area is home to over 6 million people making it the biggest metropolitan area in Canada.  Toronto was created in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe as the capital of what was then called Upper Canada. At the time it was called the \"Town of York\" after the Duke of York, but was given its current name in 1834. With the Canadian Confederation in 1867 it became the capital of the newly-created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with Montreal in Quebec) that wanted to be the capital of Canada, but Queen Victoria decided that Ottawa should be the national capital as it was located between the two. As the 19th century moved on the city began to grow. This was many because of immigration, where people from all over the world left their home and moved to Canada. Many of the immigrants were Irish and they brought their Catholic faith with them when they left Ireland because of the Irish Potato Famine. During World War I and World War II, Toronto had an important part in military, being used to train members of the Canadian Army. After the wars, even more immigrants came to the city. The population was becoming so big that the Government of Ontario decided to create Metropolitan Toronto in 1954, joining together a number of local municipalities. These were Old Toronto, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke, and Scarborough. By 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal. So the Ontario government decided to make Toronto a \"megacity\" in 1998, and the first mayor of Toronto was Mel Lastman. As Toronto moved into the 21st century, it became host to a number of worldwide events, such as World Youth Day in 2002, WorldPride in 2014, and the 2015 Pan American Games.  Toronto has a humid continental climate (Dfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). This is because although the city is next to Lake Ontario, the lake is not big enough to keep its temperature mild.[needs to be explained] As the biggest city in Canada and one of the biggest in all of North America, Toronto is a popular destination for tourists. It is where you can find the CN Tower, the tallest free-standing (not supported) structure in the Americas and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. There are some other buildings, such as City Hall and the Rogers Centre, that are well-known for their design style. There are also many skyscrapers, because many large banks of Canada and other companies have their main offices in Toronto, and the Toronto Stock Exchange which is the biggest stock market in Canada. Because Toronto is the capital of Ontario, it is where the provincial government meets, and visitors can see how the province is run by visiting the legislature in Queen's Park. There are also a number of museums, including the Royal Ontario Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Ontario Science Centre, the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the suburbs of the city is the Toronto Zoo and Canada's Wonderland, and many visitors also like to go to Niagara Falls, just an hour's drive away from Toronto. Toronto is full of places to visit, eat, shop, and enjoy. In the downtown area are a number of shopping centres, including the Eaton Centre, St. Lawrence Market, and the Distillery District. There are also several theatres, many which are run by the Mirvish family. The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, opened in June 2006, is home to the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Across the harbor are the Toronto Islands, the best-known of which is Centre Island. Toronto has many sports teams, some of which belong to the most commonly-followed leagues in North America. They include the Toronto Maple Leafs in ice hockey and the Toronto Raptors in basketball, both of which play in the Air Canada Centre. The nearby Rogers Centre is where the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team plays, and meanwhile, BMO Field in Exhibition Place is home to the Toronto Argonauts in Canadian football and Toronto F.C., a soccer club. Toronto is a very multicultural city, because different people from around the world have moved to Toronto to live since the 20th century. There is a Chinatown, Little Italy, Greektown, Little Portugal, and many more places where different cultures are kept alive. These people hold festivals where they share their culture to others, and among the most popular is the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), which happens every year in August.

It is also the largest [[city]] in both Ontario and Canada. Found on the north-west side of [[Lake Ontario]], the City of Toronto has a [[population]] of over 3 million people and even more people live in the [[region]]s around it. All together, the [[Greater Toronto Area]] is home to over 6 million people making it the biggest [[metropolitan area]] in Canada.\n\n==History==\nToronto was created in 1793 by [[John Graves Simcoe]] as the capital of what was then called [[Upper Canada]]. At the time it was called the \"Town of [[York]]\" after the [[Duke of York]], but was given its current name in 1834. With the Canadian [[Confederation]] in 1867 it became the capital of the newly-created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with [[Montreal]] in [[Quebec]]) that wanted to be the capital of Canada, but [[Queen Victoria]] decided that [[Ottawa]] should be the national capital as it was located between the two.\n\nAs the 19th century moved on the city began to grow. This was many because of [[immigration]], where people from all over the world left their home and [[Immigration to Canada|moved to Canada]]. Many of the immigrants were [[Irish people|Irish]] and they brought their [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] with them when they left [[Ireland]] because of the [[Irish Potato Famine]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], Toronto had an important part in [[military]], being used to train members of the [[Canadian Army]]. After the wars, even more immigrants came to the city. The population was becoming so big that the [[Government of Ontario]] decided to create [[Metropolitan Toronto]] in 1954, joining together a number of local [[Municipality|municipalities]]. These were [[Old Toronto]], [[York, Ontario|York]], [[East York, Ontario|East York]], [[North York, Ontario|North York]], [[Etobicoke]], and [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]].\n\nBy 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal. So the Ontario government decided to make Toronto a \"[[megacity]]\" in 1998, and the first [[mayor]] of Toronto was [[Mel Lastman]]. As Toronto moved into the 21st century, it became host to a number of worldwide events, such as [[World Youth Day]] in 2002, [[WorldPride]] in 2014, and the [[2015 Pan American Games]].\n\n==Things to see and do==\nToronto has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]). This is because although the city is next to Lake Ontario, the [[lake]] is not big enough to keep its [[temperature]] mild.{{clarify}}\n\nAs the biggest city in Canada and one of the biggest in all of [[North America]], Toronto is a popular destination for [[tourist]]s. It is where you can find the [[CN Tower]], the tallest free-standing (not supported) [[structure]] in the [[Americas]] and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]]. There are some other buildings, such as [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]] and the [[Rogers Centre]], that are well-known for their design style. There are also many [[skyscraper]]s, because many large [[bank]]s of Canada and other [[company|companies]] have their main offices in Toronto, and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] which is the biggest [[stock market]] in Canada.\n\nBecause Toronto is the capital of Ontario, it is where [[Government of Ontario|the provincial government]] meets, and visitors can see how the province is run by visiting the [[legislature]] in Queen's Park. There are also a number of museums, including the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], the [[Ontario Science Centre]], the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], and the headquarters of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. In the suburbs of the city is the [[Toronto Zoo]] and [[Canada's Wonderland]], and many visitors also like to go to [[Niagara Falls]], just an hour's drive away from Toronto.\n\nToronto is full of places to visit, eat, shop, and enjoy. In the [[downtown]] area are a number of [[shopping centre]]s, including the [[Eaton Centre]], [[St. Lawrence Market]], and the [[Distillery District]]. There are also several [[theatre]]s, many which are run by the [[Mirvish]] family. The [[Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts]], opened in June 2006, is home to the [[Canadian Opera Company]] and the [[National Ballet of Canada]]. Across the [[harbor]] are the [[Toronto Islands]], the best-known of which is [[Centre Island]].\n\nToronto has many [[sports]] teams, some of which belong to [[Major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|the most commonly-followed leagues]] in North America. They include the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in [[ice hockey]] and the [[Toronto Raptors]] in [[basketball]], both of which play in the [[Air Canada Centre]]. The nearby Rogers Centre is where the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[baseball]] team plays, and meanwhile, [[BMO Field]] in [[Exhibition Place]] is home to the [[Toronto Argonauts]] in [[Canadian football]] and [[Toronto F.C.]], a [[soccer]] club.\n\nToronto is a very [[multicultural]] city, because different people from around the world have moved to Toronto to live since the 20th century. There is a Chinatown, Little Italy, Greektown, Little Portugal, and many more places where different [[culture]]s are kept alive. These people hold [[festival]]s where they share their culture to others, and among the most popular is the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE), which happens every year in August.\n\n== Other websites ==\n* [http:\/\/www.toronto.ca City of Toronto] - Official city website.\n* [http:\/\/www.torontotourism.com\/visitor\/ Tourism Toronto] - Visitor's bureau website.\n\n{{Canada capitals}}\n\n[[Category:Toronto, Ontario| ]]\n[[Category:Cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants]]","opening_text":"Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario in Canada.

A person with pedophilia is called a pedophile. The child must be at least five years younger than the person in the case of adolescent pedophiles before the attraction can be called pedophilia. Medically, this condition is classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder. Some pedophiles have sex with children or use children in a sexual way. This is called \"child sexual abuse\" because by law, children are unable to truly agree to sexual acts with an adult. Some adults have pedophilic feelings but do not act by sexually abusing children. Some adults who are not pedophiles commit sexual abuse against children. Not all pedophiles feel or act in the same way. Since the 1880s, psychologists have studied and shown that different pedophiles might act in different ways: Some pedophiles are only sexually attracted to prepubescent children. They are called exclusive pedophiles. Some pedophiles have a sexual preference for prepubescent children but are sexually attracted to adults as well. They are called preferential pedophiles. Some adults who prefer adult sexual partners are also sexually attracted to prepubescent children. Adults whose primary sexual attraction is for early adolescents are properly called hebephiles, not pedophiles. Adults whose primary sexual attraction is for mid-to-late teens are properly called ephebophiles, but ephebophilia is not considered abnormal by mental health professionals. For pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse, some studies have shown that pedophiles who are only attracted to children may abuse more children than pedophiles who also have adult sexual partners. The people who abuse children are often known to them\u2014such as parents, other relatives, and friends\u2014and are not strangers. One research study found that half the adults convicted of child sexual abuse of children outside of their family were also sexually abusing their own children.  Medical researchers do not know how many people in the population are pedophiles. This is because it is hard to study people's feelings and desires unless they actually show that they have those feelings. Generally, the only pedophiles who can be studied are those who have both broken the law and been caught and convicted of child sexual abuse. A second reason is that when an adult or teenager sexually abuses a child, people often call the abuser a \"pedophile\", but it is possible that the abuse happened for a different reason, such as the unavailability of an adult partner. Experts generally define a person as a pedophile only if they are primarily or exclusively sexually attracted to prepubescent children. If a person sexually abuses a prepubescent child to frighten or punish them, for example, then it may not be true pedophile behavior. Some sources, such as the Mayo Clinic, report that most child sexual abuse of prepubescent children is committed by pedophiles, while other studies report that most people who sexually abuse children are not pedophiles. According to some studies, about 1% of all adult males may be pedophiles. However, other studies indicate that the percentage of pedophiles in the adult male population may vary between 12% to 22% percent.  As of 2008, most doctors believe that pedophilia cannot be cured. The current approach to deal with pedophiles who have been convicted of sexual abuse is to try to change their behavior. It does not change their sexual attraction. Using this treatment, it is believed that some sex offenders can be prevented from offending again. Medications such as Depo-Provera can be used to treat pedophilia.    \"DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PEDOPHILIA\" (PDF). APA STATEMENT. American Psychiatric Association.

A person with pedophilia is called a pedophile. The child must be at least five years younger than the person in the case of adolescent pedophiles before the attraction can be called pedophilia. Medically, this condition is classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder. Some pedophiles have sex with children or use children in a sexual way. This is called \"child sexual abuse\" because by law, children are unable to truly agree to sexual acts with an adult. Some adults have pedophilic feelings but do not act by sexually abusing children. Some adults who are not pedophiles commit sexual abuse against children. Not all pedophiles feel or act in the same way. Since the 1880s, psychologists have studied and shown that different pedophiles might act in different ways: Some pedophiles are only sexually attracted to prepubescent children. They are called exclusive pedophiles. Some pedophiles have a sexual preference for prepubescent children but are sexually attracted to adults as well. They are called preferential pedophiles. Some adults who prefer adult sexual partners are also sexually attracted to prepubescent children. Adults whose primary sexual attraction is for early adolescents are properly called hebephiles, not pedophiles. Adults whose primary sexual attraction is for mid-to-late teens are properly called ephebophiles, but ephebophilia is not considered abnormal by mental health professionals. For pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse, some studies have shown that pedophiles who are only attracted to children may abuse more children than pedophiles who also have adult sexual partners. The people who abuse children are often known to them\u2014such as parents, other relatives, and friends\u2014and are not strangers.

As with cities, there is more than one way to say what a town is in different countries. In some places, it is a kind of local government. In English, people also use the word \"town\" as a general word for places with a lot of houses (cities too). When they say \"town\" they are normally thinking of a big, important place. For example, London is a city, but people often call it \"London town\" (\"the City of London\" is a part of London where there are a lot of banks). Also, going from the outside to central London is to \"go into town\". Generally, the difference between towns and villages or hamlets is the sort of economy they have. People in towns usually get money from industry (factories etc.), commerce (shops etc.) and public service (working for the town), not agriculture (growing food). The number of people who live in a place does not tell us if it is a town or a village. In many areas of the world, like India, a big village can have many more people than a small town. It is also difficult to say if a place is a town because today, some towns are becoming bigger. Sometimes a place is a city because it got the name \"city\" by law. However, people often call a place a \"town\" if it is small. In the Middle Ages, a place became a town by means of a charter, which gave it town privileges.  In the United States of America, the meaning of the term town is different in each state. In some states, a town is a town if the state says it is. In other states, like Wisconsin, a town is a subdivision of a county (same as a \"parish\" in Louisiana). In other states, like Michigan, the name \"town\" has no official meaning. People use it to describe any place with a lot of people. In the six New England states, a town is a smaller part of the county. In all six, towns do things that, in most other states, the counties do. In many of these towns, town meetings are the main form of government, so citizens can say what happens where they live by direct democracy.In these states, the towns are really more important than the county. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, counties are only on the map and have no power. In the other four states, counties are mostly places with law powers. The counties with other functions are mostly in New Hampshire and Vermont. In New York, a town is also a smaller part of the county, but it is less important than in New England. In New York, a town gives people more direct power than its county, giving almost all town services to places not in towns, called hamlets, and some services to places in towns, called villages. In New York, a town usually has some hamlets and villages. But, because villages have power without towns (they are independent) they can be in two towns or even two counties. Everyone in New York State who does not live in an Indian reservation (a special place for American Indians) or a city lives in a town, and perhaps in one of the town's hamlets or villages. In Virginia, a town is similar to a city, but it can have a smaller number of people in it. By Virginia law cities are independent of counties (they have power without counties), towns are part of a county.  In England and Wales, the name \"city\" is only for places that have a Royal Charter (a special document) saying they can have that name. In the past, cities usually had a cathedral. Some English people think that when a place has a cathedral it must be a city, but it is not true today. For example, Northampton and Middlesbrough are towns but both have a cathedral. In the past, a place was usually a town, not a village, when it had a regular market or fair (a market, but not so often).

game consoles began in 2012 and is the current video game console generation. The eighth generation began with the release of Wii U. The PlayStation 4 was announced on February 20, 2013. It is expected to be released at the end of 2013. Microsoft announced the Xbox One on May 21, 2013. It is expected to be released at the end of 2013. For handheld game consoles, the generation began in February 2011. The first handheld was the Nintendo 3DS. The PlayStation Vita was released in December 2011 in Japan. It was available for the Western countries in February 2012. It is believed by the video game media that the eighth generation will be competing from the smartphone, tablet, and Smart TV gaming markets. Because of this, some analysts believe the eight generation will be the last generation of home consoles. Other consoles such as the NVIDIA Shield, Steam Box, Ouya and GameStick are attempting to compete in this market.         http:\/\/www.pcadvisor.co.uk\/news\/game\/3350902\/ps4-release-date-specs-confirmed\/ PS4 release date specs confirmed  \"Microsoft Confirms Next-Gen Xbox Announcement\".

The eighth generation began with the release of Wii U. The PlayStation 4 was announced on February 20, 2013. It is expected to be released at the end of 2013. Microsoft announced the Xbox One on May 21, 2013. It is expected to be released at the end of 2013. For handheld game consoles, the generation began in February 2011. The first handheld was the Nintendo 3DS. The PlayStation Vita was released in December 2011 in Japan. It was available for the Western countries in February 2012. It is believed by the video game media that the eighth generation will be competing from the smartphone, tablet, and Smart TV gaming markets. Because of this, some analysts believe the eight generation will be the last generation of home consoles. Other consoles such as the NVIDIA Shield, Steam Box, Ouya and GameStick are attempting to compete in this market.","language":"en","wikibase_item":"Q129459","version":5471393,"version_type":"external","popularity_score":1.9131180225283e-5,"wiki":"simplewiki","coordinates":[],"defaultsort":false}
